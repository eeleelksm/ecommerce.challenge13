# E-commerce Back End - Module Challenge 13

## Challenge Details
In this challenge, we were asked to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database so that the company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

This was built using MySQL2, Express.js, Sequelize, and dotenv package.
